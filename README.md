# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
As a female tech student passionate about health, I built a breast cancer prediction model using 7 classifiers. After extensive preprocessing, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning, Gradient Boosting achieved 99.11% accuracy offering a reliable tool for early, accurate diagnosis to support patients and doctors.

Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts breast cancer diagnosis (malignant or benign) based on patient data using various machine learning classification models. Accurate prediction can aid early diagnosis and improve treatment planning.

## Features
- Dataset includes key diagnostic features extracted from breast tissue images.
- Explored 7 classification models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree and XGBoost.
- Best model achieved **99.11% accuracy** with Gradient Boosting.
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning were performed to optimize model performance and generalization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
